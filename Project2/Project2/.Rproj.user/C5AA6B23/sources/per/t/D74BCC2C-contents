## Introduction
The results of the Cerry Blossom Ten Mile Run a available at http://www.cherryblossom.org/. For this paper we do a step-by-step analysis of how to web-scrape the run time data from this website. We outline the steps to get the data from the website, format the data for initial data manipulation. Afterwards, we answer Question 17 from Chapter 2 of Data Sciene in R; Nolan et al.

## Background
Question 17 of Data Science in R asks the following:
 "In Section 2.7, we discovered that the HTML ﬁle for the male 2000 results was so poorly formatted that htmlParse() was unable to ﬁx it to allow us to extract the text table from the <pre> tag. In this exercise, we programmatically edit this HTML ﬁle so that we can use htmlParse() as desired. To do this, begin by reading the HTML ﬁle located at http://www.cherryblossom.org/cb003m.htm using readLines(). Carefully examine the HTML displayed in Section 2.7 and come up with a plan for correcting it. Consider whether you want to drop <font>s or close them properly. Once you have ﬁxed the problem so that the <pre> tag contains the text table, pass your corrected HTML to htmlParse(). You may want to use a text connection to do this rather than writing the ﬁle to disk and reading it in."
 
TO accomplish this, we must fist scrape the data from the website. Then we edit the HTML file.

We then consider if we want to drop <font>s or close them. 

After this decision, we pass the corrected HTML to the htmlParse() function by using text connection.
